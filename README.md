# /cybersec-master-list

Welcome to cybersec-master-list! This is a repo that contains cybersecurity projects, loosely based on TryHackMe's [SOC Level 1](https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/soclevel1), [Junior Penetration Tester](https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/jrpenetrationtester), and [Security Engineer](https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/security-engineer-training) paths.
You'll find the following for each project:
- 👨‍🏫 Guided instructions: Step-by-step tutorials to understand the how of the work
- 🖼️ Screenshots: Images to get a visual idea of what to do - (a picture is worth a thousand words, after all)
- 📽️ Videos: 30-90s videos for proof of concept (PoC) exploits or common attacks (e.g., SQL injection).
